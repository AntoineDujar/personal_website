talk about experience of web development
- originally built with plain html and css, can talk about difficulties, managing relations between pages, how long it takes to make new pages, cumbersome syntax (all made worse by having a french version) (forgot my css classes after not working on it for a week or so)
- Change in design, product first approach to design, more interesting than reading a description of a company you might not know of
- Learning Astro which coincided with learning React, much more sustainable way of creating / maintaining a website
- Adding optimized images with the Image tag which ended up being important as the website is mainly image focused
