Flashcards+ is a flash card creation and management web application built with React on [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/), with the [Chakra UI](https://v2.chakra-ui.com/) library.

The code for Flashcards+ can be found on [github](https://github.com/AntoineDujar/flashcards) and it can be tried for yourself [here](flashcards-drab-iota.vercel.app).

Flashcards can be added manually, or for more general flashcards you can request the AI to create cards for yourself.

Using the AI to create flashcards works best for simple and general bulk requests such as "15 colours in Chinese", "First 50 numbers in French".

Recall mode displays each card individually, starting with the first side.

Following a click is the second side and buttons to indicate if you've got it correct or incorrect.

After the last card, your total of correct answers will be shown (ex: You got 18/20
correct!).

Deletion of cards and groups is handled by the edit button, once pressed turns all cards/groups red which leads to a deletion prompt once pressed.
