SpellCaster's Alley is a twist on the typical turn-based RPG where the player is able to bowl to determine points of damage, adding player skill expression to traditional turn based combat.

Further ideas would have different spells change the layout of the bowling alley and number of pins, with different spells having different base damages or multiplier based on pins hit.

Encountering enemies can influence the bowling alley adding obstacles or effects.
