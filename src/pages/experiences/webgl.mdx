import ImageImport from "../../components/ImageImport.astro";

During my graphics course I learned graphics programming, working with webGL to render objects in 3D on the web.

As a demo I created a little figure which rotates in space, you are able to move it's arms, as well as the lighting position.

Click [here](/box/index.html) to give it a try.
